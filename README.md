# Joke Rating Predictor - done as a part of the Machine Learning course @IIIT Delhi

## Introduction
This project is a joke rating predictor. It uses a dataset of 100 jokes and 70,000 odd user ratings to train a model to predict the rating of a joke. We have used classical machine learning techniques to solve this problem.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Jester dataset. It is a collection of 100 jokes and 70,000 user ratings. The dataset can be found [here](http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/).


Our approach and thought process to tackle this problem is explained in the [report](Report.pdf).
